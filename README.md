# LanisAPI

> ## âš  Notice
> **Because the Schulportal Hessen changes quickly and is very fragmented, some functions at specific schools or after a while may no longer work.**

## What is this?

It's an unofficial Python library for the Schulportal Hessen. Also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lanisapi/).

## Features

+ Fetch homework or other tasks.
+ Fetch substitution plan.
+ Fetch calendar events.
+ Fetch conversations.
+ Fetch all schools that have Lanis.

**Overview of future Features, Problems and other things [here](https://github.com/users/kurwjan/projects/2).**

## How do I install it?

```sh
pip install lanisapi
```

Required is Python 3.11. *(older versions should definitely work too but I didn't tested it.)*

## Example

This example gives the substitution plan.

```python
from lanisapi import LanisClient, School

def main():
    client = LanisClient("schoolid", "name.lastname", "password")
        or: client = LanisClient(School("school", "city"), "password")
    client.authenticate()
    print(client.get_substitution_plan())
    client.close()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
