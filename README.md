# LanisAPI

> ## âš  Notice
> **Because the Schulportal Hessen changes quickly and is very fragmented, some functions at specific schools or after a while may no longer work.**

## What is this?

It's an unofficial Python library for the Schulportal Hessen. Also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lanisapi/).

## Features

+ Fetch homework or other tasks.
+ Fetch substitution plan.
+ Fetch calendar events.
+ Fetch conversations.
+ Fetch all schools that have Lanis.
+ Fetch all web applets with their links.

**Overview of future Features, Problems and other things [here](https://github.com/users/kurwjan/projects/2).**

## App for the Schulportal Hessen
If you want to have an app for Lanis, check out [SPH-vertretungsplan](https://github.com/alessioC42/SPH-vertretungsplan) by [@alessioC42](https://github.com/alessioC42). _It's still in an early phase!_

**It would be also really nice if you contribute to this project**, like bug reporting, if you know Dart and Flutter it would be nice to see your help or you could learn Dart, it's not hard.

## How do I install it?

```sh
pip install lanisapi
```

Required is Python 3.11. *(older versions are probably not working, I didn't tested it.)*

## Example

This example gives the substitution plan.

```python
from lanisapi import LanisClient, LanisAccount, LanisCookies, School

def main():
    client = LanisClient(LanisAccount("school id", "name.lastname", "password"))
        or: client = LanisClient(LanisAccount(School("school", "city"), "name.lastname", "password"))
        or: client = LanisClient(LanisCookie("school id", "session id"))
    client.authenticate()
    print(client.get_substitution_plan())
    client.close()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
