## How do I install it?

```sh
pip install lanisapi
```

Required is Python 3.11. *(older versions are probably not working, I didn't tested it.)*

## Example

This example gives the substitution plan.

```python
from lanisapi import LanisClient, LanisAccount, LanisCookies, School

def main():
    client = LanisClient(LanisAccount("school id", "name.lastname", "password"))
        or: client = LanisClient(LanisAccount(School("school", "city"), "name.lastname", "password"))
        or: client = LanisClient(LanisCookie("school id", "session id"))
    client.authenticate()
    print(client.get_substitution_plan())
    client.close()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
